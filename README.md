Sales Data Analysis

Objective:

The goal of this project was to analyze a dataset of sales data and extract meaningful insights that could help drive business decisions.

Tools Used: Python, pandas, os, matplotlib
Key Steps:
1.	Data Preparation: Merged multiple sales data files into a single DataFrame. Handled missing values and cleaned the data to ensure it was suitable for analysis.
2.	Feature Engineering: Added new columns such as ‘Month’, ‘Sales’, and ‘City’ to aid in the analysis.
3.	Data Analysis: Performed various analyses to answer business questions, such as:
o	Determined the best month for sales and the total earnings for that month.
o	Identified the city with the highest number of sales.
o	Found the optimal time to display advertisements to maximize customer purchases.
4.	Data Visualization: Created various plots using Matplotlib to visualize the analysis results.
   
Key Findings:

•	The best month for sales was identified, providing insight into seasonal trends.

•	The city with the highest sales was found, offering a potential focus area for business expansion.

•	The optimal time for advertisement display was determined, which could help increase customer purchases.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python and its associated libraries.
It also showcases the ability to derive actionable business insights from raw data.
